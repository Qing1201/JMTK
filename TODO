  * Compile FileCheck against llvm-dev (/usr/lib)
  * Clean up CMakeLists.txt
  * Add examples for each tutorial
  * Printf - test precision smaller than string with no
   null-terminator
  * Printf - add 64-bit support
  * Testcase for gdt
  * Change qemu script to use monitor to poll for finishing (cli/hlt).

Known optimisation opportunities:
  * x86/vmm clone_address_space should do a temporary recursive
   mapping of page tables for the copy, instead of many maps/unmaps.
  * xbitmap should use 32/64bit compares instead of 8bit.
