  * Create local version of FileCheck
  * Clean up and comment Makefile and target-*.mk
  * Add examples for each tutorial
  * Printf - test precision smaller than string with no
    null-terminator
  * Printf - add 64-bit support
  * Testcase for gdt
  * change pmm to use buddy allocation


Known optimisation opportunities:
  * x86/vmm clone_address_space should do a temporary recursive
   mapping of page tables for the copy, instead of many maps/unmaps.
  * xbitmap should use 32/64bit compares instead of 8bit.
