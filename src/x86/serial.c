/**
   ============
    Serial I/O
   ============

   While generally with desktop OSes most of the initial boot IO is done via the monitor and keyboard, the serial line can be extremely useful for headless boots, or more importantly getting textual data in and out of emulators (qemu's ``-serial`` option, for example).

   A serial device is standard on x86 machines, and is accessed via ``INB`` and ``OUTB`` instructions - its registers are located in the I/O space, not the memory address space. There are normally two serial controllers, and each controller can control two serial lines.

   The primary controller has its registers at 0x3f8 (for the first device) and 0x3e8 (for the second device). Similarly the second controller has registers at 0x2f8 and 0x2e8.

   Now, in this chapter I'm not going to go into all the gory details of the serial controller. It's mainly legacy and besides, that's what datasheets are for. With that said, here are a bunch of definitions! { */

   You should get used to this. Most device drivers start with a shedload of
   #defines. Except the obfuscated ones, but they're unreadable anyway by
   design. We'll come back to some of the constants, but the important ones are:

     * ``SERIAL_RXTX`` .. ``SERIAL_SCRATCH``: These are offsets from the base
       register (for example 0x3f8) where to find specific registers.
     * ``SERIAL_RXTX``: This is the read/transmit buffer. Reading from this
       reads from the read buffer (referred to as 'rx') and writing writes to
       the transmit buffer ('tx').  ``SERIAL_LSTAT``: Line status register. This
       has two interesting bits: ``SERIAL_LSTAT_RECV_BIT`` and
       ``SERIAL_LSTAT_SEND_BIT``, which tell us if the device has data received
       (RECV_BIT) or is ready to transmit (SEND_BIT).

   Our serial driver isn't going to be stupid and block reading one byte at a
   time. If you have interrupts enabled, it should store characters received to
   a buffer so it can be read back in bulk at a later point.

   I've written an ADT (abstract data type) for this, a `ring buffer
   <http://en.wikipedia.org/Ring_buffer>`_ in
   ``src/include/adt/ringbuf.h``. Here's the header - implementing this is left
   as an exercise to the reader :) {src/include/adt/ringbuf.h,"",""} */
