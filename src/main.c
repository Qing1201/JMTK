   Introduction
   ============

   So you want to make your own operating system, huh? You've searched around,
   found plenty of resources about scheduling algorithms, memory management
   techniques and "the way Linux does it", but still don't really have a clue how
   to get started or more importantly where those ideas fit in with the big
   picture?

   This set of tutorials/walkthroughs is designed to help you stitch together
   the theory and the practical and show you the links between the two, in the
   hopes that it'll "click" for you and you'll be able to go and research new ideas
   independently.

   If you've read the previous incarnation of my tutorial series, this will be a
   slight depart from that formula. While many liked them, there was derision
   from some corners for them being too "hand-holdy" - spending too much time on
   basic C instead of the concepts it was trying to teach.

   Therefore this is more of a walkthrough than a tutorial - I've created what I
   like to call a teaching kernel. It is a simple UNIX-like operating system
   that should be portable and maintainable (one of the things that was poor
   about my previous tutorials was that it was very difficult for me to
   maintain).

   It should ideally serve as a prop or aid to show the basic concepts of
   operating system implementation or as a base upon which to experiment or
   research, perhaps as part of an operating systems 101 course (I've had this
   request in the past).

   The goal of this chapter in particular is to explain the basics of how the
   kernel we will build is structured; in particular the build system used and
   the testing methodology.

   What is an operating system?
   ============================

   Before delving into creating a kernel, let's first step back and define what
   an *operating system* actually is.

   `Wikipedia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system>`_ says:

       An operating system (OS) is a set of software that manages computer
       hardware resources and provide common services for computer programs. The
       operating system is a vital component of the system software in a
       computer system. Application programs require an operating system to
       function.

   Linux (or GNU/Linux) is an operating system, as is Windows, as is Mac OS. An
   operating system provides access to hardware, memory management and task
   scheduling capabilities, but also importantly provide some sort of shell or
   interface with which a user can interact with the system.

   The canonical shell on a Linux system is a command shell such as ``/bin/sh``,
   along with the standard utilities such as ``mv``, ``cp``, ``grep``
   etc. Without these, even with ``/bin/sh`` a user could not effectively
   interact with the system. On windows, the shell is the Windows desktop and
   Windows Explorer.

   So what is a kernel?
   --------------------

   A kernel is a part of an operating system. It runs in a privileged mode and provides and regulates access
   to hardware, task scheduling, memory management and the minimal set of
   functionality that nonprivileged applications require to work.

   The rest of the operating system sits atop this layer, exposing more complex
   functionality to the user and perhaps decomposing it into simple calls to the
   kernel to actually do some work.

   For example, the command "mv a.txt b.txt" in a shell expands into several
   kernel calls:
 
   .. image:: doc/1.png

   The shell first calls ``fork()`` in order to create a new child
   process. This process calls ``execve()`` to load the executable and start
   executing it. Once executing, ``mv`` will call ``stat()`` on both filenames
   to ensure the first exists and the second does not or exists and is not
   write-protected.

   If these both succeed, ``mv`` will then call ``rename()`` and exit, where the
   call to ``waitpid`` in the parent shell process will then return.

   Our aim in this tutorial is to create such a kernel, that a "userland" such
   as the GNU tools found in Linux or the BSD tools in {Open,Net}BSD can sit
   upon.

   This brings us nicely to the next question:

   Why UNIX?
   ---------

   As I've mentioned earlier, in this tutorial we are attempting to produce a
   *kernel*, not a full operating system. That would be a much larger scope of
   problem (although of course can be done).

   A kernel interacts with the rest of the system (OS and user applications) via
   some API, and in the case of UNIX this is clearly specified in the `POSIX
   specification <http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/>`_ - if we
   stick to this API, we should be able to build and run applications written
   for other kernels on ours. This also aids my primary tutorial goal of showing
   how theory and practice combine to produce the familiar.

   Modularity
   ----------

   Moving slightly to kernel design, there are many schools on how to design
   a kernel, and they generally form a scale from
   "everything-built-together-in-one-big-blob" to
   "absolutely-everything-completely-separated":

     * *Monolithic* - Everything is built into one kernel binary.
     * *Modular* - All functionality that can realistically be is moved into
       modules that are loaded at boot time.
     * *Microkernel* - A very small kernel, and all functionality that can be
       (sometimes including memory management) moved out into nonprivileged
       applications called "servers". The idea being that if they fail they can
       be simply restarted and not take down the entire kernel.

   An example of a monolithic kernel is "classic" Linux - by classic I mean
   "Linux as it was in 1992 when Torvalds and Tanenbaum had their infamous
   `argument
   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanenbaum%E2%80%93Torvalds_debate>`_", and the
   counterexample of microkernel is Minix (written by Andrew Tanenbaum).

   It should be noted that there are very few kernels that fit directly into one
   of these categories. Much like true free market or communist economies can
   never really exist, most tend towards a hybrid design with an inclination one
   way or the other.

   Only if one is motivated by design ideals (Minix, GNU Hurd) or abnormal
   design constraints (QNX - hard real time, safety critical) does a design
   result that can be clearly categorised into one of the above.

   That said, if I were to categorise the kernel we produce in this set of
   tutorials it would be *modular monolithic* - everything is built into one
   binary, but inside the binary everything is modularised and initialised
   separately at runtime.

   I'm going to cut the OS theory short here - this isn't meant to be a full OS
   theory introduction - see `the OSDev.org wiki <http://wiki.osdev.org>`_ or
   Tanenbaum's Minix book for a fuller discussion.

   General project structure
   =========================

   Testing
   -------

   I'm not really going to mention this much during the tutorial text, but I
   have developed this kernel such that it can be tested as much as
   possible. For each target-specific feature (such as paging) I have stubbed up
   an implementation that should work on any computer as a hosted process under
   linux. All of this code is in the "hosted" subdirectories. This allows me
   (and you!) to
   test the target-agnostic parts such as the scheduler and heap in isolation
   and with a proper debugger and valgrind.

   Along with this we also have target tests, which are run via a python wrapper
   around qEmu. The test harness itself is
   `"Lit" <http://llvm.org/cmds/lit.html>`_, which is part of the LLVM compiler
   infrastructure and is used for their testing. It's extremely lightweight,
   robust and is an exceedingly good tool.

   In the tutorial documentation I will not explicitly mention the use of tests,
   but tests will have been written for every feature and chapter. Similarly I
   will keep the focus on the target in question (x86/x64/arm), and not mention
   the hosted build at all (except for this first chapter!).

   Code layout
   -----------

   The code is layed out something like this::

       .
       +-- doc
       +-- examples
       +-- scripts
       |   +-- elftools
       |   `-- pyelftools-0.20
       +-- src
       |   +-- adt
       |   +-- hosted
       |   +-- include
       |   +-- third_party
       |   `-- x86
       `-- test
           +-- lit
           `-- x86

   ``scripts`` holds a bunch of scripts for interacting with qEmu (see later),
   generating floppy disk image (again, see later) and manipulating the graph of
   chapter dependencies (for my use only ;) ).

   All the source is in the ``src`` subdirectory, with ``hosted`` holding code
   relating to hosted mode (stubbed linux subprocess), ``x86`` holding the x86
   and x64 specific code, and ``adt`` holding some abstract data types (such as
   an extensible bitmap) used elsewhere in the kernel.

   Build system
   ------------

   Provided with the code is a simple makefile. It takes as input a target - this
   can be one of 'HOSTED', 'X86', 'X64' or 'ARM'::

       TARGET=HOSTED make

   Replace "HOSTED" with "X86", "X64" or "ARM" for your preferred target.

   Modules
   -------

   The rigorous use of modules (theoretically) allows each chapter of the tutorial to be self
   standing, and ideally fully pluggable - you should be able to just take the
   "threading.c" file, add it to the src/ directory and then end up with a
   kernel that can multi-thread.

   This is achieved using a bit of ELF magic.

   ELF stands for Executable and Linking Format, and is the object and
   executable format for UNIX systems. At the object file stage, it has the
   concept of "sections" - data normally ends up in the ".data" section for
   example, and code ends up in the ".text" section.

   Using compiler-specific attributes (GCC and Clang support them) we can
   arrange for certain variables to end up in a different section, or a
   completely new one.

   For example, given the following code in ``a.c``::

       int a __attribute__((section(".mysection"))) = 4;
       int b __attribute__((section(".mysection"))) = 6;
       int c = 8;

   The symbols ``a`` and ``b`` will end up in the section called '.mysection',
   and ``c`` will end up in the default section for data, which is called
   ``.data`` (it is usual but not required to start a section name with a dot).

   Interestingly however, if we name the section so it only contains letters,
   numbers and underscores, the linker will automatically generate two symbols - 
   ``__start_SECTION`` and ``__stop_SECTION`` - these symbols mark the start
   and end of that section.

   So let's assume we put ``a`` and ``b`` above into the section 'mysection'.
   In ``b.c``, we could then reference ``__start_mysection`` and
   ``__stop_mysection`` as external variables and use them to find ``b`` and
   ``c``::

       extern int __start_mysection, __stop_mysection;
       printf("%d, %d, %d\n", &mysection_start[0], &mysection_start[1],
                              &mysection_start[1]);

   This is how we specify which modules to load. Each module has a descriptor
   structure (called ``module_t``). One of these is made global and put in a
   special section 'modules'. Code then reads this array of modules and loads
   them in turn (depending on their dependencies, of course!).

   The advantage of this over a global list is we can add new modules without
   adapting ``main.c`` at all, which fits my personal goal of maintainability :)

   I should mention here that the kernel is designed to have two modes - to

   function as a test harness, in which case we may specify just one module to
   load and only want to load it and its dependencies (and its dependencies'
   dependencies and so on - referred to as the "transitive closure" of the
   dependencies).
